## PROBLEM STATEMENT
"Seashores are major tourist attractions. But cleanliness in our
seashores is very low. How can we mitigate this issue with the leverage
of technology? Specifically, how can we design an application that
allows users to identify areas in need of cleaning, organize and
participate in cleaning events, and receive rewards for their efforts?"

## SOLUTION
BeClean - A Community-Driven SeaShore Cleanliness
Ensuring Application. With BeClean, users can upload
pictures of places that have to be cleaned. Once the admin verifies the
authenticity of the pictures, theyâ€™ll be listed in the app as a task. So
users can come forward and participate in these cleaning events and
share the pictures of the area they have cleaned up, along with the
location of the site, and share their progress with the BeClean
community. To incentivize participation, sponsors reward users for
their efforts, encouraging them to continue participating and inspiring
others to get involved. In addition to photo-sharing, BeClean also
includes features like group creation and event organization, allowing
users to connect and collaborate with others in their area to make a
more significant impact. The admins evaluate the cleaned areas once a
month to make sure they stay that way, and if they do, we give the
team members who cleaned them earlier additional incentives
